        "# Conventions\n",
        "\n",
        "For consistency & clarity, we follow some general conventions for coordinate systems, units, and normalization. This notebook serves to document these conventions\n",
        "\n",
        "## Units\n",
        "\n",
        "The core ptychographic routines are unit-independent, so any units can be used. However, since this package is designed primarily for high-resolution electron ptychography, data is typically loaded and stored with length units of Angstrom ($1 \\:\\mathrm{\\AA} = 10^{-10} \\:\\mathrm{m}$). \n",
        "Other units typically follow SI base units.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Coordinate systems\n",
        "\n",
        "Images are stored row-major, starting with the top-left corner. Keeping with this, points are usually stored as `(y, x)` pairs.\n",
        "Raw data is changed to this convention on import.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use a right-handed coordinate system. Looking down the optic axis, the x-axis points right, the y-axis points down, and the z-axis points into the page (Forward propagation is the +z direction).\n",
        "\n",
        "In real-space, the origin is usually centered. In reciprocal space, the origin/zero-frequency point is at the top left corner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data is stored so intensity is normalized in reciprocal space:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
        "\\sum \\sum \\left| f(x, y) \\right|^2 &= N_x N_y \\\\\n",
        "\\sum \\sum \\left| F(k_x, k_y) \\right|^2 &= 1\n",
        "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This corresponds to the `norm='forward'` convention in `numpy`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Sign conventions\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase follows the convention where a plane wave is defined as $\\exp(2\\pi i (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}))$. This is the most common convention, equivalent to defining the Fourier transform as $F(\\mathbf(k)) = \\int f(\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(-2\\pi i (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}))$. However, older crystallography literature uses an opposite sign convention. See Spence and Zuo [1] for more information.\n",

        " - To FFT to reciprocal space: `F = fft2(ifftshift(f, axes=(-2, -1)), norm='forward')`\n",
        " - To FFT to real space: `f = fftshift(ifft2(F, norm='forward'), axes=(-2, -1))`\n",
        " - To normalize energy in real space: `abs2(f) / numpy.prod(f.shape[-2:])`\n",
        " - To normalize amplitude in real space: `f / numpy.sqrt(numpy.prod(f.shape[-2:]))`\n",
        " - Reciprocal space data must by fftshifted for visualization"
